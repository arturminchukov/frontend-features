        What we have is a simple Create React App, into which I’ve added some styled components goodness. You don’t have
        to stick with Styled Components if you prefer Emotion or something else - got for it. It’s just to illustrate
        the approach.

        What we’re starting with is a fairly simple little 3 page website with some “products” for sale on it. You can
        click between the products, you can select product variations, which results in their prices changing. You can
        even add them to the cart and see the cart button and cart total update.

        In the project you’ll find a components directory. This is where I’ve set up the components for the app. The
        include a product page, and smaller things like navigation, images and buttons.

        You’ll also find a theme folder. This is where I’ve set up some global CSS rules, along with some theme values
        that are injected into the components thanks to styled components. We’ll look at how this can help make our
        animations reusable.

        Opportunities to animate
        When something changes, it’s an opportunity to use animation. In this example we have lots of places where the
        UI changes.
